## **Category 1 Analysis Summary**

### **Business Purpose Analysis:**

| Test File | Role | Primary Business Purpose | Unique Validations | Overlap Assessment |
|-----------|------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `user_permissions_verify.spec.js` | **Centralized Leasing** | Tests comprehensive permissions for leasing staff | • Can edit applications<br>• Can approve/reject sessions<br>• Can request additional documents<br>• Can invite/remove co-applicants<br>• Can upload documents<br>• Can merge sessions<br>• Can delete applicants | **NO OVERLAP** - Different role, different permissions |
| `staff_user_permissions_test.spec.js` | **Staff** | Tests limited read-only permissions for staff | • Can view applications (read-only)<br>• **CANNOT edit applications**<br>• Can view session details<br>• **Buttons are disabled**<br>• **Limited access** | **NO OVERLAP** - Different role, different permission levels |
| `property_admin_permission_test.spec.js` | **Property Admin** | Tests property-specific admin permissions | • Can edit/delete applications<br>• Can create applications<br>• Can manage organization members<br>• **CANNOT edit workflows**<br>• Can edit organization info<br>• Can assign permissions | **NO OVERLAP** - Different role, different scope |
| `check_org_member_application_permission_update.spec.js` | **Organization Member** | Tests organization-level permission management | • Can view organization members<br>• Can edit member permissions<br>• Can update application permissions<br>• Organization-level access control | **NO OVERLAP** - Different scope, different business rules |

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Each test validates different user roles** with completely different permission matrices
2. **Permission levels are distinct**:
   - Centralized Leasing: Full permissions
   - Staff: Read-only permissions
   - Property Admin: Property-specific admin permissions
   - Organization Member: Organization-level permission management
3. **Business rules are role-specific** - what one role can do, another cannot
4. **These are NOT redundant** - they test different business scenarios and user types

### **Technical Setup Analysis:**

#### **Common Setup Steps (Necessary for Each Test):**
1. **Admin authentication** - Needed to create users via API
2. **User creation via API** - Each test needs its specific role user
3. **User login** - Each test needs to login as its specific role
4. **Navigation to relevant sections** - Each test needs to access its specific functionality

#### **These are NOT "extra steps" - they are essential setup for each test's unique business validation**

### **Conclusion for Category 1: NO MEANINGFUL OVERLAP**

**All 4 tests should be kept** because:
- Each tests different user roles with distinct permission sets
- Each validates different business scenarios
- The "overlap" in setup steps is necessary for each test to validate its unique business logic
- Removing any test would lose important business coverage

**Optimization opportunity**: Create shared utilities for common setup steps (admin auth, user creation, login) to reduce code duplication while maintaining all tests.
